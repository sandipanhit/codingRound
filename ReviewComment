review comments:

1. Instead of Thread.sleep we should use WebDriver wait
2. We should write all the locators and methods in another Java class. Test cases should only contain test code. 
   We should use Page Object Model if there are many pages.
3. We should take all the locators and expected output in another file(text file or properties file or excel)
4. Use setup method(Beforeclass annotation) to setup the environment and teardown method(AfterClass annotation) to close the driver.
